At least more than once, you must have thought “what’s that shiny new building” or “what’s being constructed here”. Naturally, after an exhilarating 2 years of being away from campus and then a semester here, we see that there are a lot of new buildings and ongoing construction. The people who’ve been on the campus since before the pandemic can surely tell that it does seem a bit different.
To clear your curiosities about it all, we reviewed the previous constructions and took note of new ones. Though we did our groundwork pretty comprehensively, it’s possible that we missed some minor constructions. So, continuing on our last review in 2020, we embark on the journey once again!
Maps of the construction sites and buildings, along with some important markers
Diamond Jubilee Academic Complex
The “NCL 2.0”, as we called it two years back, was under construction for the last three years. Its name was recently revealed when it was inaugurated on 20th April by Dr. Radhakrishnan (Chairperson, BoG, IITK). The 109 crore cost of the building justifies its size – a massive carpet area of 35,000 square meters, which is roughly the same as 5 football fields! It is now the largest academic building on campus by far – even the purpose of a lot of the building rooms hasn’t been decided yet!
The complex is 5 storeys, and would have various labs for UGs and PGs, lecture halls, and would also function as the department building for the Deptt of Design and the Deptt of Sustainable Energy Engineering.

Science and Technology Building
In between the NCL and the Flight Lab, the construction of the Science & Technology Building is in progress. (with no relation to the SnT Council :P)
The construction started in October 2020; and was expected to end this winter. However, COVID and lockdowns brought many halts to the work, and this 5-story building is now expected to be ready with all amenities by Diwali 2022. The project costs a little over 58 crores which includes BMS, water supply, sanitary installation, lifts, fire alarms, and PA systems.
Research Lab Complex
Adjacent to the site of the S&T Building, another construction is going on. Yes, you guessed it right, another research building! This one, called the Research Lab Complex, has been under work since April 2021 and is aiming for completion by the start of 2023. The project cost is estimated to be under 75 crores, including amenities like plumbing, sewage system, electrical works, fire alarms, lift, PA system, and a Building Management System (BMS) for centralized management of the infrastructure.
3 floors have been constructed till March 2022. If the current pace of construction isn’t disrupted, we’ll surely have many more research labs by the turn of the year.

Earth Science Labs Building
As we go ahead from the TechnoPark Building towards the Flight Lab, we come across a towering 7-floor construction nearing completion. This building is the Earth Science Labs Building. It has been under construction for the last 3 years, but due to COVID setbacks, the work hasn’t been completed yet. The work was fully halted from March to June 2020 due to COVID. The fully furnished building is expected to be handed over to the institute in the next 2-3 months. The project cost is estimated to be nearly 19.7 Crore rupees.

Aerospace Department Building
Across the road from the IME building, we have the Aerospace Department building that is nearing its completion, and by the time of this article’s publishing, might be handed over to the institute in under 2 months. It is a 7-floored building, including ground, along with a basement. As usual, this building was to be completed by end of 2020 but hasn’t been fully furnished even now. We can only assume that the delay in the construction was not only due to the pandemic, but also some other factors.
Now, being handed over, the building is nearly done up with plumbing, sewage, electrical works, fire fighting systems, CCTV systems, etc., and its cost sums up to just below 58 crores.

Core Labs Extension
Well, you can’t call every new lab building “New Core Labs”, right? Hence this one is called Core Labs Extension. Adjacent to the Materials Sciences Labs, ACES building, and the DoAA Canteen, the construction on this site was projected to end in April 2020 itself, but it’s still not inaugurated. Though out of the listed buildings not inaugurated yet, this would probably be the first.
As is evident, the building would provide more labs, mostly for the core departments such as MSE, CHE, CHM, etc. The construction is of 4 floors, including ground, and its estimated cost is about 10 crore rupees.

Faculty Building Annexe
That large building you see being built from the porch of CCD, or the skywalk near the Library? That’s the Faculty Building Annexe. Google would help you with what ‘Annexe’ means. (It helped us too :P)
The project manager tells us that this building would provide for the new offices of the administrative faculty, i.e. the Director, Deputy Director, most of the Deans, and also various other professors. The construction started while most of us were at our homes, and without any doubt, it has been rapid – the fully-functional building would be handed back to the institute tentatively before the end of this year. The tender cost of this 6-floor complex is roughly Rs. 31 crores.

Hall 14
We also have a new hostel coming up! The location of Hall 14 lies beyond Hall 13, on the diagonal road. Although we do not know much about the tender and the contract, the buildings are supposed to be handed over by January 2023, though delays might shift the deadline to the end of the even semester of 2022-23.
Also, just like Hall 13 with A-B-C blocks being functional even before the blocks D-E-F were fully constructed, there’s a possibility that Hall 14 would also be built in parts, with one-half being functional even before 2023. Well, aren’t we excited!

In part 1 and part 2 of the series ‘How Mess Functions at IIT Kanpur’, an attempt has been made to familiarize the new incoming students with the functioning of mess. In part 1 the financial and managerial aspects were discussed with emphasis on MEC, monthly bill, and the role of HECs and residents. In part 2, the working condition of mess workers and labor law violations at messes were the focus of our analysis.
In this part, we will be discussing the Per Student Per Day (PSPD) Model. After the restart of the campus following the prolonged closure due to COVID, students noticed a sharp increase in monthly mess bills. Students in many halls have started raising this issue at different levels. FCT is of the opinion that the sudden increase in the monthly mess bill is primarily due to the absence of working HECs in halls. After the restart of the messes, Halls were working either with a few old HEC members (as many had already finished their tenure) or there was no HEC at all. While the  price rise of the raw material partly explains the steep rise in BDMR, it is also a reality that the active involvement of students and HEC in mess affairs can keep the monthly bill under control. During the initial months of restart of the messes the monthly mess bills were as high Rs 110-115. At that time, the messes were following a menu prepared by the DoSA office without any consultation with students. Absence of a functioning HEC meant the students had little control over the procurement process of raw materials. In more recent times with the active involvement of HECs, BDMR has stabilized between Rs 70-80. But the fact remains that BDMR in post-pandemic time is considerably higher compared to pre-pandemic days. With the rising number of students asking about increased mess bills, the IIT-K administration is planning to introduce an alternative mess model. This alternative mess model was first introduced in 2017 and then again in 2019. On both occasions, the institute had to take back the proposals due to many limitations of that model and all-out students’ opposition.
The postponement of the mess contracts renewal for three months, which was due in February has further raised concern among the students. In May, when this renewal is planned, the majority of students will not be on campus due to semester break. In the absence of students, the institute gets a free hand to implement this new model without any consultations with or resistance from the students.  As students are the primary stakeholders in the mess, they need to understand this new model to prevent its imposition in their absence.
What is PSPD Model?
To understand the PSPD model, we must first examine the tender document of 2017 which invited bids for both the Fixed Cost Service Charge ((FCSC) present mess model) and Per Student Per day (PSPD) model. Point-wise analysis of this tender document is presented below.
1. The difference in the commodity of bidding (refer to points 3(a) & 3(b) of part-1 of the tender document)
For the FCSC model, this document states that “the Institute shall provide fixed service charge per month for providing the messing services as described in the scope of work for a tentatively fixed number of students as per the minimum wages rates applicable. However, the same shall be subject to revision, if there is any hike in the rate of minimum wages.  This excludes the cost of the raw materials or inputs which are to be borne/ provided by the residents of the halls.” In simple words, for the FCSC model, contractors or the service provider bid only for the service charge to get the tender.
For the PSPD model, this document states that “the service provider shall prepare the food in the mess by procuring raw materials and labor at its own cost as per the menu provided to them by the halls and serve it to the residents of the halls on “Per Student Per Day” basis as per the agreed rate.  The service provider shall also be required to provide all related services for the preparation, serving and cleaning in addition to any other works which are defined in the scope of works.” Here for this model, the bidder bids for the complete cost of food per day while taking into consideration the raw material, manpower, and other services required in the mess.
2. Differences in the employment of workers (refer to points 26 & 27 of part-1 of the tender document)
As per the tender document, “The cost of service under fixed cost service charge model shall remain static during the contract period taking into account the strength of 40 workers for 450 students.” For the FCSC model, the contractor must follow the students to workers ratio of (1:11.25) at all times in the mess.
On the other hand, “the “Per Student Per Day” rate shall be inclusive of all the charges i.e., the cost of all raw materials, cost of manpower being not less than 25 workers de-facto on work every day.” Here, the institute arbitrarily comes up with a figure of 25 workers per day without mentioning the number of students who will be paying for the service.
3. Mode of payment to the vendors (refer to point 39 of part-2 of the tender document)
For the FCSC model, all the payments to the vendors are made through the hall office against all the bills submitted within a payment cycle.
For the PSPD model, the contractor orders all the raw materials required and makes respective payments without any involvement of the Hall office or HEC in the process.
4. Utilization of money collected from cash coupon sale (refer to point 53 of part-2 of the tender document)
In the case of the services based on an FCSC basis, the entire realization from the sale of coupons is deposited with the hall office every month, which helps in reducing the monthly mess bill. (Refer to part 1)
In the case of the services on a PSPD basis, the sale proceeds of coupons shall be the preserve of the contractor.
What does PSPD mean to its stakeholders?
Based on the provisions, terms, and conditions mentioned in the tender document, we must examine how PSPD is going to affect its different stakeholders and how their roles change if this new mess model is implemented.
Students
Students are the primary service users in the messes of IIT Kanpur. In the present FCSC model, students pay for everything required in running a mess facility. Through the Monthly-Mess-Bill, students pay for the cost of raw materials and through Mess Establishment Charge they pay for the wages, EPF & ESI of mess workers along with the service charge (profit) to the vendor. Apart from this, students actively participate in deciding the mess menu, quality of raw materials, allocation of mess tenders, selection of vendors etc. FCSC empowers the students through HECs to micromanage the mess affairs to ensure good quality food at an affordable cost. Contractors only get a fixed service charge for managing the manpower required in the mess.
If the PSPD model becomes a reality, students will lose the decision-making authority in the mess because as per the terms of the contract, the contractor will decide on the mess menu, quality, and quantity of food based on the price which is quoted while obtaining the contract. Since the lowest bidder gets the contract, profit maximization will happen at the cost of the quality of the raw material and other services required in the mess. In such conditions, HECs will become redundant because the contract empowers the contractor to take every key decision. Thus, the students will mostly have no say in mess functioning.
The PSPD model has been advertised as a model under which the cost of food for the students will decrease. This characteristic of the PSPD model requires a serious examination. The cost of pulses, vegetables, edible oil, cooking gas, etc. is subject to constant fluctuations throughout the year. At times if the prices of raw materials go up, will the contractor serve us the food at the same price while compromising on its profit or will it be forced to increase the cost of food? Or will it be compelled to compromise on the quality of raw materials to maintain its profit? Latter two seem more likely to take place in such a situation.
Here we must remind ourselves of the marketing strategy of a private telecommunication company launched in the middle of the last decade. It dropped the tariffs for cellular and internet services almost to negligible amounts to gain a foothold in the market. After capturing the market, it increased the tariffs multi-folds. A similar scenario can arise in IITK messes once the PSPD is implemented in all the messes of the campus. Although this model is being sold in the name of lower food prices to the students, with time it can become even costlier than what we are paying today.
Workers of the mess
In part 2 of the series on ‘How Mess Functions at IIT Kanpur’, we have discussed the working condition of the mess workers under the present mess model i.e., the FCSC model. It has been laid out that there is a gross violation of labor laws in the present system where for 450 students 40 workers are employed to run a mess facility. These workers are made to work for as high as 11 hours in a workday of 16 hours without any payment of overtime wages.
In the PSPD model, the administration has asked the contractors to get the same job done by 25 workers. The work that 40 workers do in the present model is supposed to be performed by 25 in the PSPD model. What is the rationale here for such a drastic reduction in the number of workers? Is it possible for 25 workers to perform the work of 40 workers without further violation of labor laws? The PSPD model paves the way for the more aggressive and naked transgression of labor laws.
In 2019 students had analyzed the PSPD model and submitted the petition titled ‘Analysis of Per Student Per Day (PSPD) mess model and petition to withdraw it from the tender document’ along with the signatures of around 3000 undergrad and postgrad students to the IITK-administration urging that the PSPD model must be scrapped. At the same time, the opposition to this new model not only came from students but also from other campus community members like faculty members and workers. Hamara Manch, a forum for the workers of the campus also published a note titled “New Model in Hostel Messes: High Cost of Cheap Food” on the introduction of PSPD in hall mess facilities highlighting its shortcomings.
Recently, some of the students have been informed by the CoSHA convenor that the institute administration had initiated the process for PSPD implementation in November 2021 by calling quotations from the contractors. Since November, no formal communication has been made from the administration to the students. It is very unfortunate that such a major change in mess policy is being planned without taking the views of the students who are the primary users of the mess facilities.
Given the above, the students must come together as one voice and demand answers to the following from the administration:
Why was the mess tendering, that was supposed to happen in February, postponed for three months without any explanation?
If the institute administration had been requesting a quotation on PSPD since November 2021, why has no communication with students happened till now?
Since students pay for everything in the mess, why is the administration pushing so aggressively for the PSPD model which has been rejected by students twice? If the administration is concerned about providing cheap food to the students, why don’t they start with cheap education in the first place? Per semester fee at IITK for undergraduate students is as high as Rs 1.25 lakh.
Students must discuss this issue with HECs and through them, resolutions rejecting the PSPD model must be passed at hall levels as well as CoSHA, and Students’ Senate level.
We will end this part with the following questions to the students:
Are we ready to have cheap food in the mess at the expense of food quality, autonomy of HECs and our power to decide what to eat in the mess or at the expense of the exploitation of mess workers?
Can we not imagine an alternative mess model which does not perpetuate the workers’ exploitation and at the same time students can have food at affordable prices?

In the first part of this series of articles, we gave a detailed account of the functioning of messes at IIT Kanpur (IITK). We explained in detail how the mess establishment charge (MEC) and the monthly mess bill are calculated. Furthermore, our account included how the money collected from the students as MEC and the monthly bill is spent to pay the workers, contractors, and vendors. Additionally, we discussed the role HECs, students, contractors, wardens, and IITK administration play in the functioning of the mess facility. The important takeaway points from the previous part are as follows:
BDMR = Total expenditure on raw material in a month/No. of hall residents x No. of days in the month
Monthly mess bill = (BDMR x Number of days in the month) + Extra Food Items Purchased + HDF
S.No. Description Amount (Rs)
1. Salary (1200 man-days) 7,74,000
2. Service Charge (8% of workers’ salary) 61,920
3. GST (18% of S.No. 1 & 2) 1,50,465
4. PF (12% of workers’ salary) 92,880
5. ESI (3.75% of workers’ salary) 29,025
6. Total 11,08,298
Table 1: Approximate Monthly Break-up of Mess Establishment Charge for a Hall of 450 residents.
S.No. Description Amount (Rs)
1. MEC (per semester of 5-months) 13,000
2. MEC per month 2,600
3. One-month MEC of 450 residents 11,70,000
4. Total Salary paid to the workers (in 1 month) 11,08,298
Table 2: Tentative Comparison of MEC collected & its expenditure. The difference in 1-month MEC and total salary is because we approximated calculations for the sake of simplicity.
Another key point of the previous part was that it is the HECs and residents who play a key role in the management of all the mess affairs such as the selection of contractors, selection of vendors, quality of raw materials, mess menu, etc. The students need to remember that they pay for everything in the mess and they must ensure that the control of management remains with them to ensure good quality food at affordable prices.
In this part, we talk about the workers, whose labor makes sure that we are served fresh and hygienic food thrice a day. The workers of the mess found little mention in the previous report as their participation in the daily functioning of the mess calls for greater attention and focus.
The HECs, wardens, and concerned IITK officials such as DoSA, and ADHA engage in the mess affairs for a limited period. An elected HEC’s involvement continues for one year and that of the wardens & concerned IITK officials, for three years only. The mess workers are the only experienced members whose practical knowledge about the workings of a mess surpasses others. Many workers have been working in the messes of IITK for as long as 15 years. It is these experienced workers who make possible the smooth functioning of mess daily. This second part will cover the mess work and working conditions of the mess workers in detail.
Employment & Deployment of workers in Mess
As per the contract
As per the current Fixed Cost Service Model (FCSC), every year the institute invites tenders for providing services for all the messes. The contractor who qualifies the technical and financial bid during the tendering process is selected for providing services by an individual hall based on experience and the lowest financial bid. The financial bid includes the minimum wages of the worker to be employed in the mess and the service charge (profit of contractor).
The only role played by the contractor in the running of the mess is employing the required number of workers in the mess to ensure smooth functioning while following the labor laws. The contractor hires the mess staff which includes a mess manager, mess accountant, mess storekeeper, supervisor, cook, and workers involved in cooking and serving food. The hired workers are deployed in the kitchen or service area based on their experience and expertise. The contractors are the final authority to hire and dismiss the workers from employment.
As per the actual practice at IITK
As mentioned above, the mess workers are the only experienced stakeholders involved in the functioning of the mess. This experience and coordination among workers are very vital for the proper functioning of the mess. It takes a lot of time to train a new worker according to the working system of IITK messes. If every year a new contractor deploys a new workforce, it can hamper the smooth functioning of the mess. The services can become chaotic till the recruits gain enough experience of the working condition and nature of the services required at the mess. To ensure that no such condition arises in the mess, the workers of all the messes are retained even though contractors are changed.
It is through the continuous engagement of the HECs, hall residents, mess workers, and campus community that the wardens and admin have come to an informal agreement that workers are to be retained for a seamless service in the mess. At times when the requirement for new workers arises, the contractor recruits workers. In case the number of workers is higher than the required number in a hall they are transferred to another hall wherever there is a similar requirement. HECs and administration must ensure that no malpractices such as favoritism and corruption take place during employment and deployment of workers by regularly issuing necessary directives to halls and contractors.
Role of workers in the mess
Mess workers are the backbone of the functioning of the mess facilities at IITK. Their work includes:
the preparation of ‘basic daily meal’ (BDM), which includes food items consumed by residents in breakfast (such as daily changing items like poha, dosa-sambar, etc. along with regulars like sprouts, milk, tea, etc.), lunch, and dinner (one dal, one sabzi, rice, chapati, sambar, fruits, etc.).
the preparation of extra food items such as veg & non-veg items prepared almost every day on prior bookings.
to prepare the items cooked on the order of individual residents (Omelettes, paneer bhujia, fried rice, etc.).
apart from the preparation of food, workers are tasked with the servicing of the food to the residents.
other works of mess workers include the pre-cooking preparations i.e., cleaning and cutting of vegetables, cereals, etc, cleaning of kitchen and service areas, cleaning of utensils, kitchen, dining and storage area after services.
Salary and other benefits for the workers
IIT Kanpur is mandated by The Minimum Wages Act 1948 and The Minimum Wages (Central) Rules, 1950 to pay all contractual workers the central minimum wage. For each workday, a mess worker is paid the central minimum wage, which is Rs 654 for unskilled workers, Rs 724 for semi-skilled workers (assistant cook, cashier, assistant storekeeper, non-veg cook), skilled workers Rs 795 (Head cook, accountant, supervisor, and head storekeeper), Rs 864 for the highly skilled worker (Manager).
Apart from the salary, the workers are entitled to social benefits in the form of Provident Fund (PF) and health insurance through Employee State Insurance (ESI) that contractors deposit in the workers’ accounts at Employees’ Provident Fund Organization and Employees’ State Insurance Corporation respectively.
Here, we would like to mention that the minimum wages and other benefits for the workers are the product of a long struggle of workers and the concerned campus community, and their continuation depends on continued vigilance and engagement by all the stakeholders.
Working Conditions of Mess Workers
Though much attention is given to the taste and quality of the food, very little is talked about the workers who toil through the day and run the mess. We feel the students, the primary users of the mess facility should be aware of the ground realities of the working conditions in messes.
Messes at IITK work on an arbitrarily fixed ratio of one mess worker per 11.25 students. The contractor is bound to maintain this ratio, as per the contract. To understand how the present ratio works, let us assume that a hall of residence Y houses 450 residents. As per the ratio of (1:11.25), 40 workers must be present at work every day. Taking into consideration that each worker is supposed to get 4 days off in a month, a hall must employ 47 workers for 450 students. 
Workers are supposed to reach the hall mess before 6 am and start their work and they leave around 10 pm, taking only a couple of hours of breaks in between. The timing for mess services for residents is 7:30 am to 10:00 am for breakfast (8 to 10:30 am on weekends), 12:30 pm to 2:30 pm for lunch, and 7:30 pm to 9:30 pm for dinners. Workers are supposed to be present in the mess around 1.5 hours before the service of food to the residents. A worker for the breakfast comes to the mess at around 6 am and leaves around 10:30 am, after preparing and serving the breakfast and performing the necessary required work for the preparation of lunch. These workers again report to the mess at noon for lunch preparations and services and leave around 3:00 pm, after preparing and serving the lunch and performing the requirements for the preparation of dinner. At 6:30 pm workers again return to work for dinner preparation and services and leave at 10:00 pm after ensuring the necessary preparations for the next morning’s breakfast. In this way, a worker spends around 10.5 hours at work each day. However, the workers are engaged in the mess for more than 16.0 hours a day, since in their rest time they cannot work or engage themselves in any other activity. This 10.5 hours of day’s work is counted as one working day for the workers. This is a clear violation of labor law mandated for a central organization to be followed.
Section 24 of The Minimum Wages (Central) Rules, 1950 says that: the number of hours of work that shall constitute a normal working day.
The number of hours which shall constitute a normal working day shall be:
in the case of an adult – 9 hours;
in the case of a child – 4 & 1/2 hours.
The working day of an adult worker shall be so arranged that inclusive of the intervals of rest if any, shall not spread over more than twelve hours on any day.
As per point a, of section 24, the workers who are supposed to work for a maximum of 9 hours are made to work 10.5 hours daily. Whereas, as point b mandates that the working day of a worker shall not exceed 12 hours after including the time of rest, here in IITK the working days of the workers go up to 16.5 hours.
Further, Section 25(1) of The Minimum Wages (Central) Rules, 1950 says that: When a worker works in employment for more than nine hours on any day or for more than forty-eight hours in any week, he/she shall in respect of overtime work, be entitled to wages:
in the case of employment in agriculture, at one and a half times the ordinary rate of wages;
in the case of any other scheduled employment, at double the ordinary rate of wages;
Here also, even though the working hours and the working days of the mess workers exceed the time frame for normal working hours/day, the workers are not paid for overtime work that they perform every day. These above-mentioned violations of labor laws are not paid the attention that they require.
The overburdening of work for the mess workers is not just limited to extended working hours. The ever-increasing mess menus further add to the workload of these workers. By adding multiple special items to the menu, the HECs and the mess committee (the residents) force the workers to prepare more food items in that given time. For a mess worker more special items simply mean more unpaid work since they are given no overtime for the extra work.
The workers prepare and serve food not just for hall residents but also for the visitors from other halls, SBRA, RA tower, etc. Effectively, workers are further forced to work extra without being paid. Here, it is important to mention that the money collected by serving food to the non-hall residents is used to decrease the BDMR of the hall residents, whereas the workers who work extra to serve these guests get nothing from this money. This situation is further aggravated during the institute festivals like Antaragani & Techkriti where the number of non-IITK guests increases manifolds.
Here in the case of extra coupons sold to non-residential guests, it is important to remind ourselves that the workers are employed strictly according to the number of residents residing in the hall on a particular day (as per the 1:11.25 ratio). The food prepared for and served to the non-residents is not part of the calculations for the employment of workers. So, in this way, the services provided by the workers to these guests are simple unpaid work.
Beyond this everyday exploitation, on occasions like the Hall Day celebrations, apart from preparing the regular breakfast and lunch, the mess workers are forced to prepare the ‘gala dinner’ for as high as 1000 guests. For these so-called gala dinners, they are engaged in food preparations from at least one day before hall day. Not only is their labor unpaid, in most cases, but they also are not even offered a respectful plate of dinner and are asked to eat whatever is left in the end. 
As discussed in the above section, the working conditions of the mess workers are over-exploitative and underpaid according to the labor laws of the country. A serious discussion among the students and the other campus community on this issue is completely missing. Most of the discussions of the HECs, the mess committee, and the residents are limited to taste, quality, and the elaborate menu only. On the other hand, IITK admin through its activities such as the attempt to implement Per Student Per day (PSPD) mess model and through recommendations in the section [Sec 9 (b)] of the HMC report, 2021 seems determined to create more exploitative conditions for the workers. The working conditions of mess workers, and their physical and mental well-being is never part of any serious discussion at any platform of this institute of national importance.
Visible Work, Invisible Workers
This is the situation of the mess workers under the present working model (Fixed Cost Service Model (FCSC)) of the hall mess facilities on the campus. Intending to make new students on the campus familiar with the mess functioning, we have presented the whole functioning of messes through a detailed discussion of MEC, the monthly mess bill, how BDMR is calculated, the roles of residents and HEC in mess affairs along with the role and working conditions of workers in the messes. We have stressed in the last part that the students must take a proactive role in every aspect of the functioning of the mess to ensure healthy food at affordable prices for all residents. Here also, we urge the residents to widen the scope of their discussion about the mess. A more holistic discussion should take into consideration the mess workers’ perspectives on the working conditions and other issues related to their workspace. Since students primarily avail the services provided by the workers, it is the responsibility of the student community to ensure that IIT Kanpur as a principal employer makes sure that no violation of labor law takes place, and all the workers are provided with the minimum wages, health and social benefits that they are legally entitled to.
In the next part of this series of articles, we will be presenting our view on how the present mess model can be improved along with the analysis of an alternative mess model Per Student Per day (PSPD) or the thali system. It is important to understand the PSPD system since it has been proposed twice by the administration and has not been implemented primarily due to the opposition from the students.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been a tough time for the majority of us. IIT Kanpur (IITK) was also not shielded from the adverse conditions that arose during the pandemic. Two academic batches at IIT Kanpur had to start their program while not being on campus, in fully online mode. They started their academic journey in a new institute without really knowing the campus ecosystem, both academic and nonacademic. The pandemic and subsequent closure of the campus left no scope for formal and informal interactions between the newer and older batches of students. In pre-pandemic times it was through these organic exchanges and interactions amongst different batches of students that the newer ones used to get initiated in different facets of campus life. One such aspect during their stay on the campus is the functioning of the mess in the halls of residence. After the third wave of the pandemic, the campus is trying to go back to the offline mode of education. Other aspects of campus life are returning to normal. In this regard it is important for the new students to understand how the Mess functions in Halls of Residence at IIT Kanpur. A proper functioning Mess is an essential requirement for its residents to concentrate on their academic affairs. We, at Forum for Critical Thinking (FCT-IITK), take this opportunity to pen down the details regarding the functioning of Mess. In this first part of a series of articles we intend to publish, we shall be discussing the Fixed Cost Service Model that is being followed throughout the messes of IITK. We shall try to briefly explain the roles of various entities in the running of the mess and discuss the financial part of its functioning to understand how our money is being used. In the upcoming parts, we shall be discussing the different approaches that can be adopted to further strengthen this model. One part will be dedicated to analyzing a mess model called ‘Per Student Per Day’ (PSPD) proposed in 2017 and 2019 but withdrawn after students’ opposition to it.
Part 1: Fixed Cost Service Model
The present mess model of IIT-K is named Fixed Cost Service Model (FCSC).  After joining IITK, registered students are allotted different halls for their stay at the campus. IITK being an all-residential campus, all the registered students must join the hall and mess except for special cases with permission from the Dean of Students Affairs’ (DoSA) office. On joining Hall, its residents are automatically registered for the mess.
Students staying in a Hall are supposed to pay the following charges for availing of mess services:
Mess establishment Charges (MEC) (paid per semester)
Monthly Mess Bill
Mess Establishment Charges
Students are supposed to pay MEC each semester along with the semester fee. MEC for the regular semester is around Rs 13,000 and for those staying on campus in the summer semester, the MEC is around Rs 6,400. One part of MEC consists of salaries and benefits (Employee State Insurance (ESI), Provident Fund (PF)) for the workers employed in hall messes and the remaining is the service charge  (8-11%) paid to the mess contractor for providing services in managing the mess operations. Here it is important to note that the normal semester runs for five months for postgraduate students and for four months for undergraduates. 
IIT Kanpur is mandated by The Minimum Wages Act 1948 and The Minimum Wages (Central) Rules, 1950 to pay all contractual workers the central minimum wage. This central minimum wage is revised twice a year in April and October based on the inflation rates and other parameters by the Union government. Every month the mess contractor raises the bill/invoice based on the total number of workers (based on man-days) employed in the mess. This bill also contains the service charges which are payable to the contractor. In simple words, the service charge is the profit of the mess contractor. Let us take an example to understand this structure of Invoice. Let’s assume a Hall of Residence Y has 450 students residing and availing the mess facility. For these 450 students, 40 mess workers will be deployed to ensure the proper functioning of the mess for three meals a day. Since mess runs for all the days in a month, the total man-days become (40×30=1200) for a month of 30 days. At present, the central minimum wage is Rs 645 for unskilled workers. Let us assume here for the simplification of calculation that only unskilled workers are employed in the mess. For 1200 man-days the total wage component becomes Rs 7,74,000. If the service charge is 8% (assume), it becomes Rs 61,920. The total invoice cost will be Rs 9,86,385 for a month inclusive of 18% GST(Rs 1,50,465). Based on this bill, the DoSA office will release the monthly payment to the contractor from the MEC collected from the students in the semester fee. Apart from this, the institute also reimburses the mess contractor the amount of Rs 92,880 (12% of workers’ salary) for Provident Fund (PF) and Rs 29,025 (3.75% of workers’ salary) for Employee State Insurance (ESI) that contractor deposit in the workers’ accounts at Employees’ Provident Fund Organization and Employees’ State Insurance Corporation respectively. This amount is also paid by the DoSA office from the MEC charges collected from the students. Mess Establishment Charge (MEC) simply is the labor cost (including social benefits) and service charge paid by the students for services they avail themselves of at the mess.
S.No. Description Amount (Rs)
1. Salary (1200 man-days) 7,74,000
2. Service Charge (8% of workers’ salary) 61,920
3. GST (18% of S.No. 1 & 2) 1,50,465
4. PF (12% of workers’ salary) 92,880
5. ESI (3.75% of workers’ salary) 29,025
6. Total 11,08,298
Table 1: Approximate Monthly Break-up of Mess Establishment Charge for a Hall of 450 residents.
Monthly Mess Bill
Apart from the MEC, students are supposed to pay the mess bill every month to the hall account. Following are the four main components of the monthly mess bill:
Basic Daily Meal Rate (BDMR)
Hall Development Fund (HDF)
Extra food items purchased
External coupons
Monthly mess bill = (BDMR x Number of days in the month) + Extra Food Items Purchased + HDF
Basic Daily Meal Rate (BDMR)
‘Basic daily meal’ (BDM) includes food items consumed by residents in breakfast (such as daily changing items like poha, dosa-sambar, sandwiches, etc. along with regulars like daliya, sprouts, egg, milk, tea, etc.), lunch, and dinner (one dal, one sabzi, rice, chapati, sambar, fruits, etc.). This basic daily meal does not include the items cooked on the order of individual residents (Omelette, paneer bhujia fried rice, etc.).To run the mess, every hall purchases all the necessary raw items required for the food preparation. Different vendors supply the hall with all the necessary raw materials against the order raised by the Mess or the hall office. The total expenditure on the monthly BDM is divided by the total number of residents to obtain the BDMR. BDMR is the average cost of food per day in a given month.
BDMR = Total expenditure on raw material in a month/No. of hall residents x No. of days in the month
This BDMR excludes the money generated by the mess of selling external coupons. This BDMR gets modified after these coupons are taken into consideration during calculations. This will be discussed in the coming section.
Hall Development Fund (HDF)
HDF, also called ‘Establishment Charge’ in some halls, is collected by the hall every month from its residents. HDF varies from hall to hall and is usually between Rs. 40-75. This fund is used for carrying out different maintenance works and purchases in the hall.
Extra food items purchased
Apart from basic daily meals, residents of the hall can purchase extra food items such as egg, vegetarian, and non-vegetarian items. These items are prepared on the order placed in the mess. The cost of these items is decided by the Hall Executive Committee (HEC) in consultation with mess managers.
External coupons
Campus community members like other hall residents, SBRA residents, research assistants (RAs), staff, and faculty can also use the hall mess facilities. These non-hall-residents are required to purchase cash coupons for every meal they take at the mess. The cost of these items is decided by the Hall Executive Committee (HEC) in consultation with mess managers. The cost of these coupons is higher than the BDMR paid by the regular residents of the hall. Further, the total amount of these coupons sold is deducted from the total expenditure on the raw material done by the hall. This makes the final BDMR calculation formula as:
BDMR = Total expenditure on raw material – Total collection from cash coupons/No. of hall residents x No. of days in the month
Mess Rebate
Mess rebate is applicable when a student leaves the campus on a personal, medical, or academic leave for more than 3 days. The rules for mess rebate are drafted by hall HECs and vary from hall to hall. For example, if a student leaves campus for 7 days in a month of 30, then the mess bill is calculated only for the number of days that the student has taken the food at the mess, i.e., 23 days in this example. This makes the final monthly mess bill calculation formula as:
Monthly Mess Bill = (BDMR x No. of days food taken) + Extra Items purchased + HDF
Above is the overview of the different fees and bills students pay at IITK to avail of mess facilities. In the next section, we will be discussing the role played by the contractor, students’ HEC, and Hall residents. wardens and IITK administration in ensuring the smooth and transparent functioning of the hall.
Role of Different Stakeholders in the Mess 
Hall Executive Committee (HEC) (students)
HECs are the executive student bodies of each hall of residence elected every year by hall residents. The main purpose of HEC is to represent the hall residents in every decision-making related to the hall. Mess facility is one such avenue that requires the active participation of the HEC. HEC consists of two to three mess secretaries among others. The mess secretaries further form a mess committee by calling nominations from the hall residents. These volunteers help mess secretaries in managing day to day activities of the mess in a smooth manner.
Following are the essential responsibilities of HEC and the mess committee:
HEC must represent the hall in all the meetings of the Hall management committee (HMC), Council of Students Hostels Affairs (CoSHA), Student’s Senate (SS), and other forums to voice the concerns and issues of the hall residents.
Every year HEC must take active participation in the selection procedure of a new mess contractor as described by the rules mentioned in the mess contract. 
HEC must ensure that the mess contractor complies with the terms and conditions agreed upon in the contract. 
HEC must ensure that all the meals are made available to the residents at a pre-decided time without any delay. HEC coordinates with the mess manager employed by the contractor to ensure this. 
The mess committee must ensure that the contractor is following the 11.25:1 ratio (decided in the contract) while employing workers in mess. This must not be compromised at any cost as the decrease in workers employed in preparing and serving food directly affects the quality of food and service in mess.
HEC selects the vendors for the supply of raw materials in the mess by calling multiple quotations. HEC must keep the experience of the supplier, price, and quality of raw material in mind while deciding on the vendor. HEC holds full autonomy while taking this decision. HEC must ensure that they have multiple vendors for every supply at all times.  This avoids the monopoly of any vendor and keeps the prices of raw materials down. Active participation of HEC can ensure that the monthly mess bill is under control and the food quality is maintained.
The mess committee makes sure that the vendors are supplying the best (or pre-decided) quality and demanded quantity of the raw materials. HEC holds full autonomy in the cancellation of the order to any vendor if it is not complying with the pre-decided terms of price, quality, and quantity. At least one HEC or mess committee member must be present during the arrival of raw material to verify the quality of the material.
Mess secretaries of HEC ensure that the mess monthly bills are sent to the residents regularly. Complete transparency must be exercised in BDMR calculations and must be regularly communicated to all residents.  
HEC must ensure the cleanliness of the kitchen and dining areas through regular monitoring and issuing necessary directives.  
By conducting regular meetings whereby residents are asked to vote and opine on their preferred food items, HEC makes sure that residents’ choices are incorporated into the menu. Mess committee members ensure that food quality and taste are not compromised and no adulteration is done by carrying out checks in the kitchen, cold storage, and other storage for pulses, etc. HEC must arrange regular meetings with residents to know their grievances and opinion on food. 
HEC should make a mess menu keeping in mind the practical constraints like fixed labor force and seasonal availability of raw materials. Including too many items in the basic or extra menu can affect the taste of food due to the workers being overburdened. By judiciously choosing seasonal vegetables and other locally sourced materials HEC also helps regulate the cost of the menu.  
HEC must make sure that the contractor is releasing the salaries of the workers by the first week of every month along with their ESI and PF. 
HEC must address the grievances of mess workers by coordinating with the mess manager or contractor as and when required, as the problems faced by workers in their working area can affect the quality of services. 
Role of Hall Residents
Residents are the primary users of the mess. To ensure the proper functioning of the mess, residents must actively participate in the mess affairs. Residents must provide HEC with essential feedback on mess-related issues from time to time. Residents must hold their elected HEC members accountable for the transparency in the functioning of mess affairs. Residents must ensure that HEC is performing its roles as mentioned above (see “role of HEC”). Residents must provide support to HEC to make sure that their voices are heard at platforms such as HMC, CoSHA & SS.
The mess is a form of community kitchen where residents from different regions, food habits, and economic backgrounds have their food. Every resident must keep in mind that mess provides only basic food and it cannot function like restaurants. Every individual choice of food cannot always be accommodated due to different constraints such as cost of food, seasonal availability of vegetables and fruits, training of cook in food preparation, etc. Residents must be reasonable while presenting their opinions to the HEC members and must never forget that HEC members are fellow students who are devoting their valuable time voluntarily to their academics, so that mess can function smoothly for everyone’s benefit. 
Contractor
The service of every mess facility at IIT Kanpur has been outsourced to the contractors, who provide services and manage the daily functioning of the mess. Contractors have to ensure that the required number of workers needed to run the mess facility in the hall are employed every day. The contractor is responsible for the timely preparation of food, the cleanliness of the kitchen and dining area. The contractor through its manager in coordination with hall HEC ensures the smooth functioning of the mess facility.
Every contractor is responsible to ensure that for every 11.25 residents 1 worker is employed in the mess. The contractor must pay the salaries according to the minimum wage act of 1948 and The Minimum Wages (Central) Rules, 1950 to every worker by the first week of every month. The contractor must make sure that they are depositing the ESI & provident fund of workers to concerned government departments regularly. The contractor must facilitate the paperwork regarding salaries, ESI, and PF. The contractor must address the grievances of the workers as and when they are reported. 
For the services provided by the contractor in the mess, it is paid a fixed service charge decided during the allocation of the contract through a tendering process.
Role of Wardens
Each hall of residence has three faculty members as wardens appointed by institute administration on the recommendation of HECs. Each hall has a dedicated warden for mess affairs to advise HEC and the mess committee regarding the functioning of the mess facility as and when asked for.  Wardens are the signing authority for the banking affairs for the payments to the vendors and other service providers. 
Role of IITK administration
Following are the essential responsibilities performed by IITK administration through the offices of DoSA, ADHA, and wardens:
Institute every year calls for a tender for the running of all the mess facilities on the campus. Transparency in the allocation of mess tender is the important and foremost responsibility of the administration.
Through wardens in coordination with HEC, the administration makes sure that contract conditions are being complied with by the contractors.
Administration ensures that no mal-practices such as favoritism, corruption, etc. are practiced by the contractor during employment and deployment of workers by regularly issuing necessary directives to halls and contractors.
Institute administration ensures that the DoSA office clears the contractor bills well in time so that the contractor can make salary payments to the workers by the first week of the month.
IIT Kanpur administration is the principal employer of workers working on the campus. Being a central government institute, the IITK administration ensures that contractors are following The Minimum Wages Act 1948 and The Minimum Wages (Central) Rules, 1950.
Institute makes sure that necessary funds are made available to the hall for upgrading and maintaining mess facilities as and when required. 
This is the overall functioning of the present working model of the hall mess facilities on the campus. From the students’ point of view, the strength of the present mess model is that at every step, the participation of the students (primary service users) is ensured. Students actively participate in the selection of new contractors, selection of vendors, deciding food quality, mess menu, etc. The effective participation from HECs and residents can ensure that they are served quality food at a low price in the mess, as they are the main decision-makers in the mess affairs. This mess model is also very convenient for the IITK administration as students share a majority of the day-to-day responsibilities necessary for the smooth functioning of the mess facilities on the campus. This system is very important from the point of view of the workers whose hard labor makes sure that we are served food well on time every day. This system ensures that they are paid with central government-mandated minimum wages along with social benefits of provident fund and the health security scheme of ESI.
Having said that, we do not imply that this present mess model of the ‘Fixed Cost Service Model’ (FCSC) has no shortcomings and there is no scope for improvement in it. In the coming parts of this series of articles, we will be presenting our view on the scope of improvement in this mess model. Along with that, we will be presenting the analysis of the ‘Per Student Per Day’ (PSPD) model that has been rejected by the students in 2017 & 2019.

As the third wave of the pandemic began picking pace across India, students had just returned from their homes to start their new year on campus. The warm reunion did come with the tiny virus grabbing a handful of residents and sending them into a week of isolation at the Yoga Hall. Here’s an account of what their stay at the facility looked like.
Day 1-2: “A sorry solitude”
“Bhaiya, ambulance neeche aa gayi hai, jaldi aaiye.” And there it began.
When one reaches New SAC, you come here hoping quarantine isn’t a big deal. You see, there’s the OAT tower. The OAT. A place you’ve associated with unabated bustle and human activity, from the experiences you’ve had in your brief week-long campus safari. You expect this place is going to hold up to the reputation of its noisy neighbours. However, things change when you enter, tch, the Yoga Hall enters you.
The first impression is – “What a sad place, man.” It’s fifty beds, half clad, half unclad. Around ten beds are occupied. Except a few staring at their laptops, all are asleep in Indian Railways-esque blankets. You look up at the ceiling scaffolding and the vacuity of your surroundings resonates with how quarantine feels. Hollow. You try to look for a suitable bed but you realise that all the beds along the boundary of the hall have been occupied because those are the only spots where you can have a power outlet nearby. You do notice a single extension line running along the middle of the hall that has been hastily taped to the ground (they seem to take pride in the fact that they tried) only to realise afterwards that the line is unplugged and doesn’t have a outlet to plug into, anywhere in the room. Now not just you, your dying electronics are disappointed too.
And you’re fatigued. And hungry. You can hear a muffled announcement from the SIS Guard at the gate, in a language certainly not recognizable to you (only to discover later it was Hindi and the guard was announcing the arrival of meals from the mess). A few others have their plates in hand, but you have absolutely no idea how to get yours. It was only on the direction of a generous neighbour that you figured you had to call your mess manager for food. After all this, it calls for a break on the only real estate you own here – your bed. Psych, mosquitoes and no power outlets for your repellent vaporisers. It’s not a lot of time before you realise that this place is gonna get cold in the night. But no heaters.
This is just the beginning and you are absolutely oblivious about what is going to unfold in the coming days.
Day 3-4: “Mid-quarantine crisis”
Considering this part of my quarantine overlapped with a dreary weekend with despondent rain, it called for a mental breakdown of sorts. You realise that monotony has set in when the conversations in your dreams start out as, “Hum Kanpur Medical cell se call kar rahe aapki tabiyat kaisi hai?”. The only notifications which excite you anymore are texts from HC saying, “Please send vitals”. You know something is wrong when it doesn’t seem to make a difference whether you are entering the gents’ or ladies’ washrooms because it’s not like either of them is cleaner and you’re too lousy and ignorant to care. You suddenly feel like a sick patient in a hospital measuring your temperature and SpO2 and swallowing meds all day. Yoga hall even gets to your academics when you compare your lab temperature readings to your body temperature. The entire place feels like a big sauna bath instead, because of all the steam from the kettles. Like the case with all mid-whatever crises, the monotony calls for changes and new experiences. The most favourable of these being the fact that more people are coming into the yoga hall and you get to play the ‘reverse-baapu’ role, showing your seniors around the place and initiating them into the yoga hall quarantine regime.
The daily routine of life there
News spread in town, err, the hall, that one of our co-residents had typed in a furiously inspired mail to the DoSA complaining about the sheer mismanagement of this place. And that’s why supposedly there are now heaters across the room. The extension line has been plugged somewhere as the middle rows have started to populate. People have started to bring their own extension cords and the whole place has started to look like a cobweb of charger and water kettle cables lying beside extension cords looking for their kettle partner.
Among other news that spread, there seems to have been a guideline released by the Central Government, stating asymptomatic cases are allowed to exit after seven days of home isolation without retesting. This comes as a big relief to us, as the medical prescription would have otherwise suggested a stay of a minimum of ten days, and that most of us have almost fully recovered from all the symptoms. This may have also marked an overall mood transformation of this entire place, as this hall starts to feel…less hollow.
Day 5-7: “Reconciliation”
More people. More energy in the place. Still grim throughout the day, but better. At this instant, we are done, and are looking for methods of refuge from outside. Pizza deliveries from Domino’s and waffles from The Chocolate Room have started coming in. It’s almost as if people are graduating out of Yoga Hall. A lot of people are getting comfort stuff fetched by their fellows outside the gate – including packed eatables from the E-shop and mineral water bottles – for the tap drinking water at the Yoga Hall has desensitised our taste buds. Among all that, badminton racquets have also been smuggled in, so the dry and empty foyer has been changed into a badminton court facility. A high chair has been found on the first floor and is now repurposed as a referee’s chair. Alongside that, people are starting to sit on the stairs with their laptops and chai, having light-hearted discussions with the occasional laugh that reaches the quarantine area. That doesn’t mean people inside the quarantine area are not having fun – we can spot an odd group playing UNO and a few in a huddle, sharing their dishes from the extras menus of their messes.
In latest unfoldings, it has also been discovered that the speaker system the SIS guard uses, has a spare mic that lies in plain sight and it has now been hidden in a secret vault away from the guard’s access and is being used for… obvious purposes, primarily with the objective of having fun. The speaker system also has Bluetooth and that means the foyer has become a place for jamming to music as well. The whole place feels different now.
A path has also been tracked down that connects the girls’ quarantine hall to the boys’ quarantine hall, so the odd friend group (or couple) can also be spotted near the rock-climbing area of New SAC. The whole place feels as if it’s crawling back to normalcy by virtue of the cheer creeping into people’s hearts. Quarantine isn’t so bad after all.
Humans have always been known to find out means to overcome the adversities in their life and livelihood. Probably the greatest capability of the human race lies in how we manipulate and consciously mould our surroundings to suit us. So was the case with Yoga Hall and its transition from gloominess to liveliness.

Prof. Siddharth Panda took charge as the Dean of Student Affairs on October 1, 2020. On the one year anniversary of the new DoSA office, we would like to take a look at various things that have changed and been implemented in the eventful past year by the DoSA office under Prof. Panda’s leadership, thus enhancing the student’s experience and easing the processes.
Impact on festivals:
Before becoming the DoSA, Prof. Panda was the Techkriti ’20 Festival Chairman and proactively associated with the then student’s core team to understand and resolve various on-ground issues faced by students in festival bodies. After assuming the position of the DoSA, he directed all DoSA office officials towards devising collaborative measures, and brought about a much-needed ideology shift where fests are viewed as IITK’s prestigious events rather than mere student activities. This became a key in not only handling the logistics to conduct festivals, but also maintain the standard according to IIT Kanpur’s stature. One of the phenomenal initiatives was the maintenance of a constant feedback loop from the student bodies, which led to identification, addressing and quick resolution of all existing problems.
A major result of his efforts in this field is reflected by the fact that the accountability and promptness of the DoSA office towards festival issues has increased significantly. One of the parameters that highlight the success is the reduction of Turn-Around Time (TAT) to 5 working days from 20 working days, and our DoSA aims to reduce it down to 48 hours for any problem. There has been a drastic enhancement in the transparency and efficient management of financial accounts of festivals from the past DoSA. 
The most prominent issue prevalent in the history of all festivals was the carrying over of work and dues from past editions of festivals leading to massive delays in planning of current editions and constant pestering to students.This has now been completely solved by the DoSA. Overall, the processes have been outlined and guidelines have been structured, and the vision of aligning festivals with IIT Kanpur’s vision thus bridging student activities with a long term mission of IIT Kanpur has come into play under Prof. Panda’s able leadership.
Facilitating the return of students:
After the first wave of COVID had subsided in the country, numerous committees were formed to streamline the return of students back to campus starting September 2020. Although Prof. Panda officially became DoSA on 1st October 2020, he along with other committee members played a pivotal role in bringing back the students and resuming normal operations in the campus in the aforementioned committees. His office in tandem with offices of DoAD, Security, DoIP, and Health Centre devised ways to ensure that the students could start coming back without any major hassles. 
The proactive attitude of the DoSA office led to the return of students in a phased manner, thus making it a stand-out decision in an unprecedented and challenging situation. Proper SoPs were laid out which realistically made the return a carefully planned event. DoSA ensured and instructed all officials to promote regular sanitization, proper quarantine and availability of adequate infrastructure making the stays of the students hassle-free. When the infamous decision to send back the students was taken in April 2021 due to the onset of the deadly second wave, DoSA and the concerned offices arranged for important supplies such as masks, face shields, medicines etc. as well as conducting RT-PCR tests, aiming for the safe transportation of students.
After the second wave had died down, the DoSA office became fully engaged in managing the return of students back to campus. A separate batch of resource-constrained students was also called back to campus – a decision that DoSA supported Students’ Gymkhana. He maintained a rapport with students through constant interactions over problems and student’s apprehensions and worked towards resolving them on the highest priority. “Our 50-minute discussion classes often stretched to 2-3 hour-long discussions in which sir talked to us in the capacity of a regular person, rather than in the capacity of DoSA or a course instructor.”, said Ayush Anand, a 2nd-year student enrolled in the CHE251 course under Prof. Panda. 
Creation of DSAC and ISAC
Once the students had been sent back, DoSA felt there was a need for structure in student affairs similar to that in academic affairs, implementing a ground-up mechanism that ensures a more democratic process for decision-making. Thus, ISAC (Institute Student Affairs Committee) and DSAC (Department Student Affairs Committee) were born. Apart from a convener, DSAC has student nominees. This is in line with DoSA’s belief in student governance. ISAC and DSAC function as strong recommendation bodies working on entry and exit guidelines, quarantine policies and other decisions pertaining to student affairs. The creation of both DSAC and ISAC has led to increased student representation and student voice in decision making over student affairs.
Recent protest over HMC document
Recently, there was a massive sit-in protest against regressive changes introduced by a committee formed on 16 August 2019. It was before Prof. Panda’s tenure as DoSA, this committee constituted by the HMC was formed. It is to be noted that the recommendations formulated in a report were forwarded to the Chairperson Academic Senate before he assumed the charge for DoSA. This has been further warranted by the statement “(submitted to the Chairperson Senate on September 30, 2020 for admittance in Senate)” in the interim ruling of the Chairperson Academic Senate. 
The DoSA himself was at the site of the protest to answer to the student groups and bring light on this issue. Being associated with the IIT culture for a long time, himself being an undergraduate from IITKGP, the DoSA firmly believes in the IITK culture that gives rights to students. He is of the opinion that rights should be given to students & they should go hand in hand with responsibility. He further works with the philosophy that a collaborative effort between the administration and the student bodies can go a long way in building up an accountable, quick and democratic process in IITK.
Increased visibility and promptness to respond to issues raised by student representatives
It is important to understand that DoSA is a facilitator of decisions. DoSA has taken up prompt action to almost all the issues raised by the student representatives. One such key issue was the summer term of 2021. Since the students had missed out on the lab components of the course due to the academics shifting to online mode as per the new normal of covid times, the institute decided to complete the lab components of all the institute core courses in the summers, so no difficulties are faced in future regarding the completion of the degree. Since students need to pay tuition fees for the courses taken up during the summer term, many students felt it was unfair on the part of the institute to demand fees for the courses which would’ve been completed during a normal semester. When the student representatives reached out to DoSA, a decision from the office was conveyed to the campus community regarding the fee waiver. All this happened in a matter of a few hours.
Another major issue addressed promptly by the DoSA was the extension of the deadline for a scholarship. It was due to some clerical error leading to many queries on the part of students. DoSA, again went ahead to help students out with the extension of the deadline to apply for the scholarship.
Decrease in Bureaucracy
Earlier the roles of members in the DoSA office were ad hoc and tasks were performed by anyone who would be available at the moment. During the one year of his tenure as the DoSA, Professor Siddharth Panda has been prompt and has segregated the roles of various individuals in the office, increasing the ownership of the work of any individual. Now everyone has a definite set of tasks/queries which they will cater to. Measures have been taken to revamp the DoSA website where contact details of all the members from the DoSA office were shared to help students to reach out to relevant authorities without going through layers of bureaucratic delegations. To improve the efficiency of work and make things easier for the staff, various cells have been formed and each staff member reports to a dean in-charge of their activities. This has made the work environment very friendly for the staff who feel they are being valued for their work and treated well, and ensured a productive environment.
We all acknowledge the vast amount of initiatives and work done by DoSA in a small time of 1 year given the fact that he took charge of the seat in the most challenging times, when not only us but the whole world was facing hardships. We thank him and appreciate the efforts and his constant support to the student body. We are looking forward to having more new developments as he starts with the second innings of his tenure.

In Conversation with Prof. Yogesh M. Joshi

Prof. Yogesh Joshi, from the Department of Chemical Engineering at IIT Kanpur, has recently been chosen for the prestigious Academy Excellence Award of the Defense Research and Development Organization. He is presently serving as the Dean of International Relations and Pandit Girish & Sushma Rani Pathak Chair Professor. With his 17 years of service at IIT Kanpur, Dr Joshi has made significant contributions in his field of research and expertise. He is an elected fellow of the Indian National Academy of Engineering and has a number of awards and honours to his name. He was graced with the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award in Engineering Sciences for his pioneering scientific research work.
In the following excerpts, Prof. Joshi talks about his journey as a part of the institute, shares experiences from his research career and opines the situation and scope of modern-day undergraduate research interests.
You have been recently chosen for the prestigious Academy Excellence Award of Defence Research and Development Organization. Can you detail us on it and provide some bits of your concerning work?
I cannot detail my DRDO related work given the confidentiality, but I’d like to briefly talk about both experimental and theoretical work undertaken in my field of research.
The thrust of my work is on a topic called ‘Soft Matter’, which, in a very crude language can be defined as a material with modulus less than 1 MPa. Several liquids with significantly high viscosity to soft solids fall under this domain and can be seen in our day-to-day lives as well as in industry. More specifically, I work in the field of ‘Rheology’, wherein essentially the deformation and the flow dynamics of soft materials is studied. Besides practising the fundamental work, we have also been in close association with several agrochemical, petroleum, home-care and personal-care industries for at least 10 years now.
What were your initial goals and expectations at the start of your research career? How has your experience been since then? What has been the most rewarding aspect of your academic career?
While being in an institute like IIT Kanpur, teaching has always been the most rewarding experience for me. One thing which I have immensely enjoyed in the last 17 years is to teach subjects like Thermodynamics, Fluid Mechanics and Rheology.
Basically, when it comes to teaching, any subject which has a strong mathematical basis tends to attract me. I also like to bring out the mathematical richness of a particular subject, primarily because it simplifies the concepts even more. Besides, getting involved in research and publishing papers, mentoring the Masters and PhD students has been an important aspect of a faculty’s career.
I did my PhD from IIT Bombay in 2001, and for 3 years I was in New York as a Postdoc. After that, when I was planning to come back to India, my Postdoc advisor suggested, “If you are going back to India, the best place is IIT Kanpur.” Since 2004, I have enjoyed being here and IIT Kanpur is indeed worth it!
You have been a part of IIT Kanpur for 17 years as a faculty member. How has been your experience as a professor? Do you draw out an influence of your teaching in your research work?
I have met very hard-working and dedicated colleagues in the institute who have been a constant source of inspiration for the last 17 years of my work. Seeing them progress through publishing notable papers and making strides in their field of work has motivated me to propel myself forward through these years. The PhD students have contributed a lot to my research work and have been amazing to work with, besides the undergraduate students whose curiosity and dedication have never stopped astonishing me!
I would say, and I believe that excellence is valued at IITK and this place has been nothing short of heaven for me throughout these years.
How do you think the research facilities of the institute have developed and changed over the time period that you have been here?
From the early 2000s, this place has changed so much and for the better. The research facilities and the infrastructure is second to none. And whatever the rankings may say, IIT Kanpur has an excellent environment for the growth of a faculty and any student.
A thing I have often heard of is that IIT Kanpur is more exacting than other IITs, which according to me is definitely an asset and not a liability.
There is a general myth around research that it is not as rewarding as the corporate world and many students tend to deviate from it thereby, what is your say on this?
Academia is a totally different ball game than the corporate world, in fact, both are disparate at their very essence. Some may want to solve industry-level problems in two ways, either by doing corporate research or by indulging in academia. Both the options have their perks and pitfalls, so we can’t conclude whether one is superior to the other. While the industry may give you a higher salary, academia, on the other hand, will give you the option to dictate your research problems.
In academia, “you are your own boss” and you have to make a choice about what you want to do, irrespective of whether someone likes it or not.
How are you coping with your research and teaching strategies in current times, given the limited resources and no real interaction with the students?
While several problems remain tacit in these challenging times; for me, giving online lectures poses a considerable hindrance. While recording lectures, I make it a point to make sure that my PhD students attend them, since there is nothing more dispiriting than simply speaking in front of an empty screen. As for the postgraduate students working with me, I give them theoretical problems, given the present resources constraints. Although this gets significantly abstract, since not all students can proficiently analyse and explore those experimental domains through theoretical fronts, in the present times, we are left with no other option.
You’ve been a visiting professor at numerous institutes over the years; so according to you, what are some aspects where we differ from other institutions on research fronts or have a scope of improvement?
From what I believe in, IIT Kanpur has its own strengths and downsides. While we have a splendid infrastructure and creditable quality of education, we do lack on certain fronts. As a matter of fact, it is generally deemed that the research output of the western universities is far better when compared to the Indian ones. This output is an essential consequence of everyone’s share of work, and it is the hard work component we lack upon.
In the American system, the faculty is taken to an absolute task, i.e. to be confirmed in their job position, they are expected to complete a set of predefined tasks. Other western countries follow the tenure system. This system evaluates the newly recruited and existing faculty members through assessments and impels them to work rigorously throughout their careers.
On average, the postgraduate students abroad are significantly more hardworking than what we find in India. I do feel that Indian academia is not on par with other globally adopted systems, and there certainly lies a scope of improvement. At every juncture, students and faculty members have to improve their work ethics to curb the qualitative difference which stands stark today. 
To be successful in academia, you need three things – hard work, hard work and hard work. I believe everyone has more or less similar intellectual capacity, hard work is something that differentiates you from the rest. Even if you are the finest brain, without working righteously, you may end up doing nothing productive in life.
It is quite recent that you’ve become the senior editor of Langmuir – an acclaimed publication of the American Chemical Society. How has your experience been as a part of it?
I consider myself fortunate to be on the Editorial Board of Langmuir. Being the youngest person on board, at times, I do not consider myself to be as worthy as other senior colleagues. It’s a prestigious responsibility and I have to deal with the best possible research papers from anywhere in the world. But from a realistic perspective, it is an honorary job and a greatly learnable experience to cherish for years to come.
In research, there can be days at a stretch when you don’t find something worthwhile and it requires constant patience at one’s end. How did you tackle those days and what keeps you motivated to work during those hours?
There are two aspects of research work – several times we indulge in focused research where the problem is well studied theoretically, and we know about significant parts of the domain. However, for other nebulous fronts of it, the work is focused enough to yield results from the researcher’s end. This is unlike other kinds of research, where one is exploring a field from the start, with a fair chance of failure.
While doing experimental research, one has to be very patient. Getting the results just once is not sufficient; you must have reproducibility of it. This might be coupled with any possible forthcoming difficulty. There can be instances when the instruments may give up and stop working altogether, and one needs to wait to resume the work on the same.
As an experienced faculty member, I am well aware of these aspects, but this can be highly demoralizing for the one who is just beginning a career. Thus we tend to occupy students with both difficult and simple problems so that if something fails, then there is always another thing to look forward to.
As a PhD fellow, you need to have your work done on some good sets of problems. But if you happen to stumble in your project, this often brings discouragement and loss of interest. So as a professor, you need to be in close and continuous contact with the students and guide them through thick and thin.
When one doesn’t succeed, it is not a personal loss, it’s a team loss.
A successful PhD is not about the number of papers you’ve come up with. It is essentially about how successfully you’ve trained yourself in a particular field. That makes the entire difference. Independent thinking, good writing abilities and problem analyzing skills are all part and parcel of doing a PhD and count for success.
How would you comment on the undergraduate research interests in the institute? A number of students have fair research interests but they lack in settling with a decision on whether to pursue it. What do you say about it?
Talking of undergraduate research interests, I believe that if a number of students aren’t enthusiastic to pursue it, then they aren’t the ones solely accountable. Instead, it is a failure on our part as well, for the inefficacy in keeping up with student’s interest in the research environment.
I also feel that students must have a more disciplined life during their academically focused phases. They should be working all over the year and not during the onset of exams. Reading, playing sports and good utilization of time should be practised wisely.
At the end of the day, it’s their life and they are the ones responsible for the decisions they make.
With several coveted awards, fellowships and experience in hand, what are some of the greatest takeaways which you have had from your journey? What would be your advice to the students who want to develop a career in the same?
For any career, one must be prepared to do hard work. One should be observant, possess an inquisitive nature and believe in things only after reasoning them rationally. Blind faith is one of the poisons of research. The practice of reading extensively and developing good writing skills goes a long way.
One should manage time well and be surrounded with good company; set vivid goals and have the conviction that you have taken birth to do great things in life.
In the words of Swami Vivekananda,
“All the power is within you. You can do anything.“

As another online semester reaches its mid-way, the lack of access to the Internet and consistent electricity supply has come across as a major bottleneck for the resource-constrained students. Vox Populi talked to resource-constrained undergraduate students across different batches to learn about the challenges they face during the online semesters and the assistance, if any, they have received from the administration.  The stories were narrated to Vox correspondents over phone calls and have been presented as-is. All names have been used with the consent of the concerned students.
Chandra Shekhar (Y19, CE) 
I come from Jehanabad, Bihar. In the online semesters, I broadly face three problems: one, I have a very slow internet; two, the electricity supply here is very erroneous and goes off often; and three, my daily expenses in college were reimbursed by an external scholarship I had managed to get. But now at home, since I cannot provide the bills (like mess bills for food), I am unable to avail the scholarship and that has financially affected my family.
Due to frequent blackouts in my area, I nearly missed interviews I was shortlisted for, in the internship season this year. In fact, to give Citi Corp’s interview, I had to go to a friend’s house, which had an inverter.
The response of professors to my problems have been varied, differing from professor to professor. Unfortunately, there is no uniform policy, which the college administration follows about these problems. But most of the professors do not accept email submissions, saying that it isn’t their problem and defer the responsibility to the DoAA. This creates huge trouble for me.
I feel like people who have contacts and more friends are able to perform better during the online semesters. I have very few social contacts and hence, I think I suffer academically due to high averages. 
Yes! If I am called back to the campus, most of my problems- electricity supply, slow internet and scholarship- would be solved!
Pratap Singh (Y19, CHE)
I reside in a village in Rajasthan. The internet speed I get here is 0.3 kbps! To put this in perspective, I need to walk 1 kilometre from my village to send a Whatsapp message! 
The previous president (Nikunj) had helped me a lot. I used to get offline material in pen drives and my quizzes used to happen over email. However, in the next semester, when the president changed, all of this stopped! (He said he hasn’t contacted the current president with his issues yet).
In addition to the Internet issues, my family’s financial conditions are very poor. Also, I live in a joint family, so my house does not have a proper environment to study. Therefore, I rented a room in the city, where I could get better internet. I stayed there for 3 months, during which time my academic performance significantly improved. 
But since we couldn’t afford the room any longer, I have come back now! Due to poor internet access, I cannot watch lectures and have to make do with the downloaded slides.
I also couldn’t prepare for the internship season because all resources were online and thereby, inaccessible to me. Moreover, I couldn’t seek help from friends, since I have lost contact with most of them during the online semester.
Some professors have helped me a lot like Prof. Pankaj Apte had waived some of my quizzes where I faced internet problems. However, some professors are ‘cruel’- they do not allow students in the class after the first 5 minutes and so, I am often left in the waiting room!
I had emailed the DoAA a lot of times about my problems, but have received no reply. The only help I have received was from the previous president.
I believe that I can do much better academically if I get access to better internet. I am doubly vaccinated now and hence, request the administration to call me back to the campus as soon as possible!
 <Name Retracted> (Y18, MSE)
I come from a village in Rajasthan and here, we have pathetic internet speed!
With 3 labs every week of 3 hours each, I face a lot of problems due to my internet. Moreover, exams which have proctoring over Zoom or which require submission of large files are very troublesome for me. The other issue is that I live in a house with 24 members – hence, the environment is not exactly conducive for my academic pursuits.
I am very concerned about the upcoming placements because firstly, I am unable to access online resources, thanks to my internet problems. And secondly, I cannot attend long Zoom interviews as my internet gives up after some time!
I have emailed the DoAA and the DoSA multiple times but haven’t received any help from them! The only help I have received is that some professors have given me 10-20 extra minutes for submission, but that was also not allowed by all professors.
<Name Retracted> (Y20,CE)
In my district, there is only one network provider, who provides decent connectivity. However, the tariff plans are substantially expensive. With ‘camera on’ policies being adopted in some of my courses, if we have a couple of classes and an exam on the same day, then rationing of the internet plan becomes a major hassle. In case of a disruption, my instructors have most often not paid any heed to submissions via emails and appeals through forums have not garnered any response. 
Additionally, I come from a Hindi-medium school. Although I attended remedial classes, I find it hard to grasp lecture content. In fact, one of my professors also ridiculed Hindi-medium students in a class and called them ‘backward’. 
I tried reaching out to the Counselling Service and the Hall Office for help, but I did not receive any concrete response to my concerns and the network connectivity issues still persist. 
I think it would be very helpful if the institute provides some financial aid to students facing such issues in the online semester so that we can at least make a substantial effort to catch up with our peers in academics.
Jitesh Sethi (Y20, CHM)
I live in a town in Nagaland and face frequent power cuts. Even today, we didn’t have power for the entire day. In fact, I don’t own a laptop, which means that I have to attend all my classes and appear for my exams with the help of my phone. This is a major bottleneck for me because I faced issues in my first year where I was only able to submit 3-4 pages of my 16-page long answer scripts. 
Moreover, I live in a joint family and I don’t have a personal room for attending classes and appearing for exams. There are always people present since we don’t have separate rooms for everyone. 
With sporadic internet connectivity and limited facilities, the online semester is tough to keep up with. I had emailed professors in my first year about my concerns but I didn’t get any reply. This semester, I brought my problem up with a professor in class, however, I was told that it wasn’t his domain to act on it and that there was little he could do. There isn’t any formal mechanism in place to ask for any aid in this matter!
Campus reopening would definitely solve most of my problems since a little personal space, ample internet connectivity and appearing for exams would be comparatively very easy than what it is now.
Bhawani Shankar (Y20, ME)
I live in a home with only one room, meaning that some of my family members are often present while I have to take exams or attend classes. Since my home is also near the highway, it becomes quite cumbersome to attend lectures without disturbance. Screen times have increased drastically in the online semester, and health-related concerns like body aches, the strain on the eyes and ears and improper sleep too have affected my academic performance to a significant extent.
The network connectivity issue is very real. I’ve faced disruptions in connectivity during lectures and the problem during exams has led to me losing a lot of marks in the first couple of semesters. I tried to reach out to professors regarding the network connectivity concerns, however, I’ve either not received any reply or have been told that it is my problem to deal with.
With the lab courses this semester, a number of us living in rural cities face a problem since we need to go to the city, which is about 20km from my place, to get the necessary apparatus to complete the experiment. This frequent travel and the unavailability of certain materials in my locality means that I’ve to spend added time and money to be prepared for the coursework. I also know of certain friends who are not able to afford expensive laptops and are facing issues running heavy softwares like AutoDesk Fusion 360, which are mandatory for coursework in my department. 
Reopening of campus would mean that several of these problems are solved for resource-constrained students. It’d also help to reduce academic stress on students. Any aid from the administration and the faculty would really help us, students, to make the most out of the coursework we have.
Our opinion
While we could cover only so many students, these problems plague a much larger section of the student community. The online semesters have led to increased inequity, as we all do not have access to the same resources. We believe that calling back resource-constrained students would solve most of these problems, and this should have been prioritised long before. It is welcome to hear from the DoSA (in his email dated 6 September) that discussions to call back resource-constrained students have begun but it remains to be seen when the actual plan materialises.

This interview was originally published by PhDs Of India on 1st September 2021.
PhDs of India is a group of scholars who are running an initiative to bring out the stories of research scholars at various Indian institutes who work behind the scenes and contribute steadily to the progress of science, culture and finance.
Do make sure to follow their work at: https://phdsofindia.in/
What was your motivation to pursue engineering and then follow it with a PhD?
I was born and brought up in a family of engineers. That and my love for Mathematics initially influenced me to pursue a BE in Electrical Engineering. During my undergraduate studies, I developed an interest in Communications and felt the need to delve more into the topic. So, instead of following the conventional route of taking up a job after engineering, I opted for an MTech at IIT Kanpur. I met some of the best scholars in my field at IITK who transformed my perspective towards research. Therefore, in the hope of doing fundamental communication research, I joined ISRO after my MTech. But I quit after a year and enrolled myself in the PhD program at IIT Kanpur. My experiences there during my MTech had convinced me that I wouldn’t find a better research environment anywhere else to pursue a PhD.
How was your PhD journey?
My five years as a PhD student at IIT Kanpur were some of the best years of my life. I got the opportunity to interact and learn not just from renowned scholars but also from outstanding peers. The frequent interactions with my supervisor, Professor P.R.K. Rao enriched my day. In addition to profound scientific advice, he also inspired me to learn things outside my research area. Although my journey was relatively smooth, doing a PhD in the pre-internet era posed some significant challenges for all of us.
How was your experience publishing papers at that time?
Publishing papers in high-impact international journals was difficult. Telephones and letters were the only modes of communication. In addition, there was an obvious bias at the time as India wasn’t recognized at the international level for cutting-edge research. Fortunately, things have changed for the better in the last fifteen years. The IITs and other institutes have now started emphasizing research and technology development while increasing the intake of post-graduate and PhD students. We now have an ecosystem where students can nurture their scientific acumen and produce good quality work, capable of competing at the global level.
How do you balance your research and administrative work?
I spent the initial days at IIT Bombay delivering good quality content and making an impact in my courses. I guess that motivated some exceptional students to join my group. I worked closely with them in the laboratories and in classes to implement my research ideas. Sadly, the interactions got affected over the years, as I started to dabble with administrative roles. I became a part of government committees and regulatory bodies and actively took part in policy-making. I believe it is essential for researchers to be a part of policymaking in line with the current technological trends to create possible roadmaps for future research. They might find them uninteresting due to a lack of deep technical content. However, it is imperative for the country’s development because their participation can make a huge difference. Now, as a Director of IIT Kanpur, I can only dedicate weekends to my students. I have been fortunate to have students who took the initiative and didn’t require much assistance. All they usually needed was a slight nudge and encouragement. My students are one of the reasons why I have been able to balance my research, academic and administrative responsibilities. However, the ongoing pandemic has brought in considerable challenges to researchers, faculty and administrators alike.
What motivated you to work on the Frugal 5G challenge?
After my PhD, when I eventually joined IIT Bombay as a faculty member, I wanted to focus on developing technologies indigenously and making India technologically self-reliant. The motivation to do so traces back to my early research days, where I had observed that some of the challenges we faced were unique to our country. And when I was in the process of building my research group, I met some incredible academicians who shared my vision. Prof. Ashok Jhunjhunwala was one of them. His mission was to develop beneficial indigenous technologies and make them accessible to the country’s larger population. Similarly, in my entire research career spanning about thirty years, my focal point has been developing indigenous technology and making the country technologically superior. For the last twenty years, my research group has extensively focused on system building and making technological interventions like broadband and wireless systems accessible to a larger population. The concept of ‘Frugal 5G’, i.e., delivering affordable wireless broadband to rural areas, is one of the outcomes of our research endeavor.
How has the pandemic affected you as a Supervisor and a Director?
As an administrator, taking a call that would please everyone is generally a difficult task. The current crisis has made it even more challenging to make some tough decisions. We always carefully weigh the ‘pros and cons’ and keep the larger interest of the institute in mind. But still, it was a hard time when we had to send the students back to their homes considering their best interest. It is not always possible to make decisions we ‘like’ in an administrative position. Not everyone may like the decision and not every decision turns out to be correct, especially when a judgment call needs to be taken quickly, like during a pandemic. But we have to keep moving forward. A good administrator corrects their mistakes whenever the opportunity to do so presents itself.Like everyone else, research in my group has been affected too. Unlike those who work on theoretical problems, some of my students who work extensively on experimental testbeds for 5G needed access to hardware and a laboratory and were greatly impacted by the lockdown. Nonetheless, despite such technical difficulties, I am fortunate to say that all my students have received full financial assistance even after their stipulated five to six years.
How important do you think are academic and industrial collaborations?
I have always been a cheerleader of industry-academia collaborations and have collaborated with industries and government since the beginning. While the funding from government agencies has gone towards setting up the laboratories and other infrastructure, the industry projects are funding the manpower. Industrial collaborations can make researchers aware of real-life problems, thereby paving the path for translational research. A significant amount of understanding is required for realizing prototypes and developing user-friendly products and although in our country, some industries do not have an in-house R&D ecosystem and are looking at basic engineering solutions, the scenario is changing in many places. Such facilities are gradually being set up and I think it is an equal responsibility of academicians to collaborate with these industries and improve their research.
What is your opinion about the current entrepreneurial ecosystem in India?
We have been working in the direction of making our country self-reliant and globally competitive by developing cutting-edge state-of-the-art technology. The IITs and IISc were originally set up to be the hubs for technological and entrepreneurial advancements. While the initial 30-35 years of the IITs were mostly spent on teaching and mentoring engineers, the focus has shifted to research and entrepreneurial pursuits in the last 15-20 years. PhD students are now highly encouraged to work on translational research and allow their ideas to become prototypes, products, and finally go commercial. It has even inspired NITs and other colleges to take this route and build such ecosystems for research and entrepreneurship. With a population of 1.3 billion, there is no dearth of talent in our country. In fact, it can be seen as the engine that drives the country to develop an entrepreneurial ecosystem rooted in high-end technology and become self-reliant in the true sense.
Do you think India should have its own research journals?
Initially, when the Telecom Standards Development Society, India (TSDSI) was formed along with Prof. Bhaskar Ramamurthi, Prof. Ashok Jhunjhunwala, and several other colleagues, we asked ourselves, “should we be adopting India-specific standards to further our work?”. I think if we do so, we aren’t taking advantage of economies of scale operating globally. Our objective should be to develop intellectual property, patents, and influence global standards, ensuring impact at both national and global levels.Though I strongly believe in making India self-sufficient in technological advancements, I don’t however think we are at a similar level to start our own journals addressing these indigenous research work. The readership is an essential factor; without an active engagement, we cannot sustain write-only journals. We need more researchers and more academics and strive to improve the quantity and quality of research so that a wide range of people can read and understand the work done here.
How important is it to publicize your research on social media?
At this moment, social media and science communication play a prominent role in engaging the general public in research. In my opinion, it is not just enough to do high quality research but also to communicate it to the public. People, in general, might not understand everything you do, but conveying your research on social media serves to get feedback from the layman. Sometimes such feedback triggers ideas on how to improve your research or direct it to help society in a better way. Science communication also prevents research from being confined to a small community.
What makes one a good PhD student and a good supervisor?
As PhD students, you should keep in mind that you aren’t in an endgame and shouldn’t get disheartened if you don’t get favorable results or your papers are rejected. PhD is just the beginning and you have an entire life to develop your skills and make progress. The guidance from a supervisor plays a vital role in these scenarios. The supervisors should help and encourage students to do high end research that gets global recognition and ensure more of their research gets published in international journals. As a final piece of advice, I would like to point out that every individual has strengths and weaknesses; recognize those and harness your strengths instead of focusing on eliminating your weaknesses.

Professor Dheeraj Sanghi recently retired from the Department of Computer Science Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. He spared his valuable time to share some excerpts from his undergraduate days at IIT Kanpur, his experience as an Academic Administrator across engineering institutions in India in a candid interview with us. 
In the following excerpts, Prof. Sanghi reminisces about his IIT Kanpur days and talks about his journey as an undergraduate in the 1980s to a successful academician and a pioneer in academic administration in the modern day. 
Prof. Sanghi completed his Masters and PhD from the University of Maryland, US. After being a technical staff member at Nokia Bell Labs, he stepped into Academia, joining the CSE department as a professor. In subsequent years, he handled many positions like Dean of Academic Affairs and Chairman of the SUGC. He didn’t restrict himself to one place. He made significant contributions to academic administration across several institutes in India, being the Director of LNMIIT, Dean of Academic Affairs and Dean of External Relations at IIIT Delhi, visiting faculty at IIT Bombay, Director of Punjab Engineering College and Guest faculty at IIT Gandhinagar. Currently, Prof. Sanghi is the VC designate at JK Lakshmipat University, Jaipur.  
Q. How were your days as an undergraduate student at IITK back in the ‘80s?
→ The four years of my B. Tech at IITK was a lot of fun. I knew that being in Computer Science meant that there would be fervent competition in academics, but that did not stop me from participating in any of the activities. I remember being part of every committee one could think of, and I was the one present everywhere money matters were to be handled. I was trusted to handle the money, and I was good with people. Eventually, every purchase for the sports committee, the cultural committee and the presidential committee went through my purview. I was part of the Hockey team as well, and even though I never became a Senator, I am sure that I had attended more Senate meetings than any of the elected Senators. All in all, I had a great time during my undergraduate days at IITK.
Q. What were the key factors that motivated you to pursue a career in academia?
→ Well, it’s difficult to say. Towards the end of my B.Tech, I was very sure that I didn’t want to get into academia, and after my third year, I had the impression that I’d complete my MBA next and then have my startup, and back then, startups weren’t the technology-based ones, they were the ones which meant setting up your own shops and businesses. And I just knew I wanted to be my boss. And now that I think of it, I had all the wrong ideas about pursuing an MBA. I had decided in my head that my next destination was IIM Ahmedabad and that post my MBA, I’d have my shop, but one day, my very dear batchmates, after coming to know of my plans, asked me if I was an idiot?! And they convinced me that someone as bright as me shouldn’t settle back in India but should pursue a second degree in the US. While I had dismissed the idea because I knew I couldn’t afford the entire financial burden it’d entail because I couldn’t even have borne the fees to appear for GRE and other exams. However, my friends supported me then and gave me three drafts of 110 bucks each to help me sit for the exams, and I did sit for the exams and finally applied to foreign schools and got admitted to the University of Maryland.
Even after going to the US,  initial plan was to complete my MS and then come back to India, complete an MBA from IIM Ahmedabad, and open up my shop. And I was then told that if I wanted to do an MBA, why not pursue it in the US itself, and then I appeared for the GMAT. I aced the exam with a complete score of 800 without even preparing for it. I had topped the exam globally, and post this, when I started getting admission calls from Universities, my then supervisor challenged me, saying that I was only pursuing an MBA because I couldn’t do a PhD. I remember I took the challenge head-on and went on to complete a PhD as well.
Post my MS, I came back to India, and I had worked on Networking and had this zeal to transform India and work for the recent projects which had just started. I remember applying for a position to work in the field. Still, the coordinators everywhere at IITD, IITB and IITK gave me the honest response that the project employees are mistreated, and even though I asked them that if they knew employees were mistreated, why would they continue with it, but they just told me that the system doesn’t change and that if I wanted to work on it, then I should complete my PhD and then come back and join the project.
Post my PhD, I had no clue what kind of job I wanted and if I wanted to stay in the US anymore or come back to India. My supervisor told me to take four weeks and visit India to explore the job opportunities. So I remember going to IITs and applying for the role as a professor and to corporate firms as well, and the response I got was very contrasting. Every corporate firm told me that they’d only consider me for the job after I had completely shifted back to India completely, and that was understandable to an extent since many people from the US would prefer to stay there. However, all the academic institutions told me that they’d consider me whenever they’d have their next selection committee meeting. With a couple of letters of appointment in hand, I knew that I would pursue Academics. And to be honest, I am thankful that I got into academics because this is a great job, and every year, we meet so many young and enthusiastic people with so much energy.
Q.Since your days as an undergraduate at IITK in the ‘80s, how do you think the perception of IITK and IITs in general changed over four decades?
→ I think the image of IITs has improved drastically in the last few decades. When I got selected for IIT, My father wasn’t certain if joining the institute was worth it because the fees here were more than double what it was at Delhi College of Engineering. And I remember having to convince my father that IIT was the better place. Back then, people did not realise the difference between the IITs and other colleges, and many people with ranks in the thousands would choose Delhi College of Engineering over IITs. Today, students with not so good ranks would prefer IITs over any other colleges, and the reputation of IITs has increased severalfold.
Q.  There was this shift from the AIEEE regime to JEE Mains and Advanced exam. And today, four JEE mains exams are conducted before the JEE Advanced. Do you think this process has changed the dynamic of admissions in engineering institutions in India? And is it a plus to have this system, or are there any cons to it as well?
→ There was a discussion during the shift from the AIEEE system that there was a need to evaluate students on things other than Physics, Chemistry and Math. Therefore, it was thought that the two stages of the exams would mean that the initial exam was an aptitude test, whatever that entailed and then the second exam to test the Science and Math subjects. It was discussed that the colleges could use a combination of scores in the two tests to define their criteria for admissions. However, there was a lot of opposition from the IIT Council to having an exam that would be common to admission to IITs and non-IITs. Now, the first exam serves as a prerequisite to the second exam, and the first exam is the one that is responsible for ranking students going into the non-IITs. Hence, this exam too had to have Physics, Chemistry and Math and not just aptitude. One couldn’t have had rankings solely based on Aptitude and English scores, and hence, the entire idea of the Aptitude tests was scrapped.
I think we should have more exams for admissions, in fact, multiple exams. The whole idea of having just one exam or as few exams as possible is a braindead idea. We should have multiple exams and multiple parameters to define admission criteria instead of just one single exam. The AIEEE to JEE shift hasn’t changed many things, and it hasn’t made any difference to the kind of students we get, but I think we could have used the opportunity to have more talented people join the IITs.
Q. How was your experience as the Dean of Academic Affairs at IITK?
→ The work of DOAA is purely an administrative job, and the work is to implement the academic decisions taken. I, in general, would not have enjoyed the job, as I wanted to have some influence on the academics. Later, I realised that I definitely had some influence in the decision making, in the sense that, in the Deans’ meeting, one can say things and ask the Senate to consider it. In the name of the implementation, you can always sneak in a few things, for example, at the time of pre-registration, you will be given the timetable for the exams so that a student can choose their courses properly if the endsems of two courses are clashing even though the schedule is not. So, these kinds of things can be done. I thought of it as essential and failed to implement the students’ feedback for the faculty. Whenever we take a survey, it is expected that the survey results will be shared with the people who filled it, to whomsoever I talked, they said that if someone asks for this information, then under RTI, we will have to share it and that is the problem. The RTI act also states that if you think that some information is sharable, you can share it before someone asks for it, on your website or any other place. It was clear that this information will be of interest to many others and thus should be shared, and I did share it one semester, and we had to take it down within 48 hours as there was so much opposition. Otherwise, I was pleased with this position and had a remarkable tenure.
Q. It is common knowledge now that the number of students entering IITs is increasing. Is it true that the quality of students graduating from IITs has deteriorated over the years? If so, what are the possible reasons?
→ I don’t think the quality of graduating students has gone down. What has changed is the mindset of the children. For instance, the percentage of students in our times who would take up a course solely because it is interesting was far higher than it is now. Students will think about which course should be taken to get a better job, a better CPI. And the whole focus on the placement is problematic, and that is in direct line with the coaching culture. When you have lived 2-3 years of life with such a narrow goal, it becomes hard to live if you don’t have a specific aim after achieving that goal. Thus, the first-year students need to set up a goal very fast, but they hardly know anything, their potential, their interests and then they set up the goal as “let me get a job at the end of these four years”. So, they start questioning if a particular course would help me get a job in this company or that place. These students can change the world, and if they have a goal of getting a job, that creates problems.
Q. After your experience at IIT Gandhinagar, How do you see the new IITs fare in comparison to the older IITs and do you see a difference in the educational systems of these institutes?
→ In general, I think the new IITs are trying to replicate the old IITs, IIT Gandhinagar being slightly different. However, most of the new IITs have the old IITs as their mentor, and thus they want to become the same. Maybe they have more flexibility for the students and as such, but if you compare in the last 15-20 years, the freedom has depleted a lot.
Q. How do you see the current online mode of teaching, and do you think it has any significant benefit/harm compared to the offline mode of education?
→ In the current pandemic time, we have no option but to go online because we cannot bring many students together. I think that IIT Kanpur could have made better decisions, and decisions made were probably the most irrational ones among the IIT system. Going forward, I believe the tier-1 universities will go back to the classroom system, but the tier-2 will keep the online ongoing, maybe. Take, for instance, person X is teaching in the classroom and the same person conducting online lectures, most people will prefer in-class education. However, if you ask the normal average faculty teaching in class and the best teacher in the world teaching online, the answer is different. So, my take is that there will be a mix of online and offline education in the post-pandemic times.
Q. What plans do you have now, post your retirement from IITK?
→ I have joined a private institution in Jaipur, and I plan to work on the things that I have thought of for the past 15-20 years and implement them, which was tricky in a government setup. I was in a private institution for two years, and those were the best two years of my life. Hopefully, this will be the last job that I take on. Let’s see what happens ahead.
Q. Any advice that you’d have for students at IITK and in engineering institutions across India?
→ Somehow, the students have this mindset that the only thing that matters is CGPA and their personality, but the learning doesn’t matter. Skills don’t matter. This is troublesome. This is why we see students having fun in their first and second years and then a sudden shock in the third year of not getting internships. What matters in life is the skills and education you obtain and learn. Your skills are important. You have plenty of time to gain that knowledge, play games, have fun, and be culturally involved. So, you can plan to change the world. You don’t have to worry about getting a job. Do hard work sincerely, and you will get the results.
